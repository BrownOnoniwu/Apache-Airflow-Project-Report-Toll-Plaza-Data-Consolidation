Apache Airflow Project Report: Toll Plaza Data Consolidation_Project OverviewProject Overview

Imagine you are driving on a national highway and you encounter a long queue of vehicles waiting to pay the toll. You are frustrated by the delay and wonder why the traffic is so congested. You are not alone. Millions of drivers face the same problem every day.

This is where our project comes in. We are a team of data engineers at a data analytics consulting company. Our objective is to de-congest national highways by analyzing road traffic data from various toll plazas. Each toll plaza is operated by a different toll operator with distinct IT setups, utilizing different file formats. Our project’s goal is to collect, consolidate, and transform the data from these sources into a single, standardized format that can be used for further analysis and processing.
